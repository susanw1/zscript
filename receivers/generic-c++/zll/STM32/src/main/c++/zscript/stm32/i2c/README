Found two distinct types of I2C subsystem, provided more obscure features aren't used:
Looking inside implementations:
grep -r "I2C" . | grep -i -o "version=\"[^\"]*\"" | sort -u
gives:
Version="F0-i2c2_v1_1_Cube"
Version="i2c1_v1_5_Cube"
Version="i2c2_v1_1_Cube"
Version="i2c2_v1_1F7_Cube"
Version="i2c2_v1_1U5_Cube"
Version="STM32MP13_i2c1_v1_0"
Version="STM32MP_i2c2_v1_3"
Version="STM32U5xx"

STM32U5xx is grep shrapnel, and all the i2c2 versions are equivalent enough to use the same library.
Note also that the STM32MP13_i2c1_v1_0 chips also use the i2c2_v1 implementation. The reason for this is unknown.

TODO:
The main remaining problem is resolving system/dma vs dma, system/clock vs clock, etc.
Also, how we do interrupts, and include the cmsis libraries from st, like `stm32g484xx.h`, `stm32g4xx.h`, `core_cm4.h`...
I'm also trying to kill my reliance on those as much as I can - particularly the structs (like `RCC`), and am part way through reworking the clock system to that end...

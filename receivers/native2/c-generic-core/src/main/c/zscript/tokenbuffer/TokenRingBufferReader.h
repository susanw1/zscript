/**
 * Represents the view of a single readable token in the buffer. The first readable token is computed from the `readStart` position of the TokenBuffer,
 * and subsequent tokens are calculated using this token's length, like a linked-list. They are deliberately small and stateless, so they
 * should ALWAYS be passed by value, not reference.
 *
 * <p>At a higher level, it has the following rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>you can only create a ReadToken from the valid start of the readable space, or from another token.</li>
 * <li>you can't go off the end of the readable space - the tokenBuffer pointer will be NULL for any such invalid token object.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Any operation which returns a ReadToken should fail when these rules are broken.
 *
 * <p>Token-based operations include allowing access to the numeric fields, and creating an iterator for accessing the token's data as a series of contiguous byte arrays (including
 * navigating extension tokens). A ReadToken is also used to flush preceding tokens, allowing the readStart position to be updated (flushToToken()).

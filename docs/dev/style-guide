Do not use static variables inside methods - they can (sometimes) cause the compiler to pull in 70k of handler code, as they have complicated edge cases.
Instead declare the variables in the class, and access them from there.

When pulling in large templated libraries, ensure that only one cpp file includes the whole thing, as otherwise compilation times can explode. This includes zcode.hpp, Ethernet.h, etc.
